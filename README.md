# Library-Management-system
 The main objective of this project is to design a Library Management System.
 This project demonstrates a standalone application, which is used to maintain the record of the library and can 
 be accessed by both customer and librarian. 
 This is based on file handling in C++. 
 The data is retrieved from files and inserted into an AVL Tree for easier searching.
